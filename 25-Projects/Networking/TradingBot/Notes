To create a trading bot in Python, you will need to learn the following skills:

Python programming: You will need to be proficient in Python programming in order to create a trading bot. This includes familiarity with basic programming concepts such as variables, data types, loops, and control structures.

API integration: Most trading platforms and exchanges provide APIs that allow you to programmatically access market data and place trades. You will need to learn how to use these APIs in order to build a trading bot.

Trading concepts: A trading bot needs to be able to make informed decisions about when to buy and sell assets. You will need to have a good understanding of trading concepts such as market trends, risk management, and technical analysis.

Machine learning: Some trading bots use machine learning algorithms to make predictions about market movements. If you want to build a trading bot that uses machine learning, you will need to learn about different machine learning algorithms and how to apply them to trading.

Data analysis: Trading bots often require large amounts of data in order to make informed decisions. You will need to learn how to acquire, clean, and analyze data in order to build a trading bot.

Overall, building a trading bot requires a combination of programming skills, API integration, and trading knowledge. By learning these skills, you will be well-equipped to build a trading bot in Python.
